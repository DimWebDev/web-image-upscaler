## 1) Executive Summary & Elevator Pitch

**Elevator pitch:**

> A privacy-first, stateless web app that lets anyone upscale and enhance images entirely **in the browser**. No accounts, no uploads, no data retention. Drag-and-drop, compare before/after, and download—typically in under five clicks.

**Core value proposition:**

* Immediate, measurable image improvement
* Zero-friction access (no signup, no limits)
* Strict privacy (client-side processing, stateless sessions)
* Clear, quality-first UX with built-in comparison

**Primary objectives:**

1. Deliver visible and measurable image enhancement using client-side processing.
2. Maintain complete privacy with no server persistence.
3. Provide an intuitive, sub‑5‑click workflow from upload to download.
4. Achieve practical cross-browser coverage (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

**Non-goals (for MVP):** user accounts, server-side processing, mobile app packaging, advanced editing features (e.g., cropping, color grading), batch processing, watermarking, cloud storage.

---

## 2) Problem Statement

Users who need quick image enhancement are blocked by existing tools that demand registration, impose limits, or upload content to servers—causing friction and privacy concerns. Solo developers also need a scoped, technically feasible project that can be shipped with free resources and web technologies without backend complexity.

**The app solves:**

* Friction (logins, paywalls, quotas)
* Privacy concerns (no server uploads; all processing is local)
* Lack of clarity about improvement (integrated before/after proof)
* Overly complex editors (a single-purpose workflow that “just works”)

---

## 6) Scope — MVP vs. Out of Scope

### In MVP

1. **Client-side upscaling & enhancement** (single image at a time).
2. **Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload** with visual feedback.
3. **Format support:** JPG, PNG, WEBP.
4. **Before/after comparison:** side-by-side static comparison.
5. **Quality metrics (client-side):** display PSNR/SSIM (or similar) where applicable.
6. **Download enhanced image** in same format as input.
7. **Progress/status messaging:** analyze → process → finalize.
8. **Graceful degradation:** fallback to a lower-intensity enhancement tier.
9. **Memory/size guardrails:** user-friendly warnings and guidance.
10. **Clear privacy disclosure:** stateless, no uploads, no storage.

### Out of Scope (for MVP)

* Accounts/auth, history, cloud saves.
* Batch/multi-image processing.
* Advanced editing (crop, color, retouch, denoise as a separate tool, etc.).
* Mobile native apps or desktop packaging.
* Telemetry or remote analytics (beyond optional user-triggered feedback forms).

### Later Candidates (Backlog)

* Interactive slider compare view.
* Presets (Quality vs. Speed).
* Offline PWA install optimization.
* Additional formats (TIFF, HEIC), RAW preview.
* GPU feature detection to suggest optimal paths.
* Light-touch batch mode (2–5 images).

## 7) Core User Flows

### Flow A — "Upload to Download" (happy path)

1. User lands on page; sees privacy note and drop zone.
2. User drags image or clicks to select.
3. App validates format/size; shows messages if needed.
4. App shows **Analyzing → Processing → Finalizing** statuses.
5. On success, show **Before/After** side-by-side and objective metric(s).
6. User clicks **Download** to save enhanced image (same format).

**Completion target:** ≤ 5 clicks from landing to download.

### Flow B — Error/Degradation

1. Primary enhancement fails or exceeds constraints.
2. App switches to fallback mode; explains expected outcome difference.
3. If fallback succeeds, proceed to comparison + download.
4. If all fail, show clear next steps (e.g., reduce dimensions) and retry affordance.

### Flow C — Memory/Size Warning

1. On import, detect dimension or estimated memory over threshold.
2. Provide options: proceed (risk), recommend pre-resize, or use fallback.
3. Continue with chosen path; persist choice only for the current session.

* Single-image intake (JPG/PNG/WEBP), validation, enhancement, compare, download.
* Stage-based status and clear error handling with fallback.
* Client-side computation only; no external calls for image data.

**Non-Functional**

* Privacy: stateless, no persistence beyond session, no tracking.
* Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA live regions for status, adequate contrast.
* Reliability: stable across supported browsers; avoids unhandled crashes.
* Performance: quality prioritized; visible progress within 2s; reasonable memory footprint.
* Internationalization: English-only MVP; copy written at 8th–10th grade reading level.

---

## 10) Acceptance Criteria (MVP-wide)

* Users can complete the full workflow (upload → compare → download) with ≤ 5 clicks.
* Visual improvement is apparent in the comparison view on representative test images.
* Metrics (when shown) indicate equal or better results vs. original.
* Error handling provides actionable next steps; fallback succeeds in ≥ 70% of failure cases in QA.
* Cross-browser tests pass for latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Safari on desktop.
* No data is sent to servers; no accounts or telemetry are present.

---

## 11) Risks & Mitigations

1. **Library quality insufficient**

* *Mitigation:* Evaluate ≥ 5 options early; define minimum threshold for “acceptable improvement.”
* *Contingency:* Pivot to simpler enhancement/optimization if upscaling fails expectations.

2. **Processing time unacceptable**

* *Mitigation:* Communicate quality-first stance; clear status; consider post-MVP presets.
* *Contingency:* Offer lightweight fallback that is faster but acceptable.

3. **Browser memory constraints**

* *Mitigation:* Guardrails, warnings, and fallback tier; optional pre-resize guidance.
* *Contingency:* Recommend smaller input; fail gracefully without crashes.

4. **Cross-browser edge cases**

* *Mitigation:* Test matrix early; document caveats; ship workarounds where feasible.
* *Contingency:* Temporary browser-specific limitations disclosed in UI.

5. **User value not obvious**

* *Mitigation:* Prominent comparison UI; concise copy to explain benefits.
* *Contingency:* Iterate on comparison UX; add example images (locally bundled) to demo effect.

---

## 12) Validation Plan

* **Usability tests (5–10 users):** Observe task completion, friction points, comprehension of privacy model.
* **Local prompts:** Ask for quick rating on improvement prior to download (not transmitted).
* **QA matrix:** Record success/failure and error categories during internal testing.
* **Cross-browser verification:** Weekly runs during build; final full pass before release.

---

## 13) Release Criteria & Definition of Done

* All acceptance criteria met; test matrix green on target browsers.
* No critical or high-severity defects outstanding.
* Privacy statement and in-app disclosures present and accurate.
* Performance acceptable on representative images (team-agreed benchmarks).
* Documentation: quick start guide (one page) and FAQ (privacy, limits, errors).

---

## 14) Open Questions

* Do we include an interactive slider compare in MVP or defer to v1.1? (Currently **defer**.)
* Do we show metrics by default or behind an “advanced details” affordance?
* What are the exact initial dimension/size thresholds for guardrails?
* Should we optionally allow users to export settings used (as text) alongside the image?

---

## 15) Implementation Plan (Non-technical)

* **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2):** Evaluate candidate enhancement approaches; define quality threshold and pick initial path; draft copy.
* **Phase 2 (Weeks 3–5):** Implement core flow; comparison UI; status and errors; fallback path; privacy notice.
* **Phase 3 (Weeks 6–8):** Cross-browser stabilization; usability tests; performance polish; documentation and release.

---

## 16) Appendix — Glossary

* **Stateless:** No server-side sessions or storage; no long-term client storage besides the in-memory data necessary for current processing.
* **Fallback:** A reduced-intensity or alternative enhancement mode that is more tolerant of constraints.
* **PSNR/SSIM:** Objective metrics that approximate perceptual quality; higher generally indicates better fidelity.
