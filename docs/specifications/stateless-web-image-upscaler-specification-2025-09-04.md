- Provide intuitive user experience requiring under 5 clicks for complete workflow
- Achieve cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Success Criteria:**
- 80%+ processing success rate for common image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
- Measurable quality improvement validated through integrated before/after comparison
- Processing time scales appropriately with image size (quality prioritized over speed)
- Zero data persistence with transparent error handling and graceful degradation

**Scope Boundaries:**
- Included: Client-side image upscaling, drag-drop interface, before/after comparison, error handling
- Excluded: User accounts, server-side processing, mobile app packaging, advanced editing features

## Problem Definition

**Comprehensive Problem Statement:** Users requiring quick image enhancement face friction from existing solutions that demand registration, impose usage limits, or raise privacy concerns through server uploads. Simultaneously, solo developers need technically feasible projects achievable with web technologies and free resources within realistic timelines.

**Target Audience with Validated Preferences:**
