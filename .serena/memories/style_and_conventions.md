Code style and conventions (inferred):
- Language: TypeScript 5, prefer strict typing where feasible.
- React: functional components and hooks; prefer small, composable components.
- CSS: Tailwind utility-first; PostCSS for processing.
- Formatting: Prettier 3.x; run on save or pre-commit hook.
- Linting: ESLint 9.x with react/jsx-a11y rules.
- Tests: Vitest with React Testing Library; aim for unit/component tests and a11y checks with vitest-axe.
- Naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for React components.
- Docs: Markdown in docs/; keep PRD/specs and tech stack up to date.
